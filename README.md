# ExitShortcut
Just a simple script to let you type short commands in any window

# Intallation:
1. install Python3 (from the official python page)
2. Install pip (Download & Run get-pip.py that you will find when searching <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=python+install+pip&rlz=1C1ONGR_deDE959DE959&oq=python+install+pip&aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0i20i263j0l2j0i20i263j0l4.329j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8'>"python install pip"</a> on Google)
3. install Pynput and pywin32 with pip (Run "pip install pynput" and "pip install pywin32")

# Usage:
1. Run the ExitShortcut.py Script
2. Just type whatever command you want to use in any frame (not the command Prompt)
3. Press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to run the Command

# Commands:
- hide: Hide the active frame
- show: Reopen the last hidden frames (Press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER multiple times to reopen all)
- showall: Reopen all hidden frames
- exit: Close the active frame

## Warning:
I think this only works on Windows... But just try it out!
